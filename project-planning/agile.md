## [Agile Software Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)
* A method of developing software that follows the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) and the [12 Agile Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). The name Agile was chosen to reflect the need for software development to be "agile" when facing changing requirements and technologies.
* Instead of focusing on processes and procedures, Agile emphasizes that the people creating the software are more important, allowing them to become self-organized, collaborative, and cross-functional teams.

### Agile Frameworks
[Scrum](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/)
* An agile framework that works best for small cross-functional teams (ex. marketing, technical and management in one team) that aim to deliver products while making the work easy to manage. Scrum is short for "scrummage", a term used in rugby to describe a tightly-knit and organized team formation.  
* Scrum fits well with organizations whose main business is not the technology products they are creating. Examples are consultancies and large non-tech companies.

[Kanban](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/kanban/)
* A method for visualizing the work created by a team. The most popular tool used for this is probably [Trello](https://trello.com/). Can be used both by software development teams and service delivery teams. Kanban means "signboard", which is the main view used to show the tasks in progress for the project. 

[XP / Extreme Programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/)
* An agile framework that focuses heavily on collaboration, automation, and testing to deliver higher quality software. The name came about because its practicioners took basic software engineering practices to an "extreme" level.
