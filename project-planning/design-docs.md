## üñçÔ∏è Design Docs

The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.

### Why create a Design Doc?

1. Identify design issues before investing in development.   
2. Resolve uncertainty around proposed solutions through conversations inside and outside the team.  
3. Record design decisions and thought processes.  
4. Create team alignment around what to build.  
5. Improve cross-functional communications.  
6. Give everyone a say in the design of a feature, not just the most assertive members.  
7. Save time and effort for senior members of the team.  
8. Act as a knowledge transfer mechanism for new members and members outside the immediate team.  

### When shouldn't I create a Design Doc?

1. When the extra work of the design doc outweights the benefits.
2. If the solution is already clear to the team.
3. When rapid iteration is needed to arrive at a solution, hence the doc will just be more extra work.

### Structure of a Design Doc

1. Background on the problem. 
2. Short list of goals for the project.  
3. Given #1 and #2, explain the what's to be built. Include trade-offs and reasons for choosing the solution.  
   Some things you can include are:  
   * üé® Diagrams, wireframes and other visual aids that will help explain the concepts. 
   * üîß Rough design of any APIs it creates.  
   * üìí Data that it will create and/or store.  
   * üßÆ Novel PoCs or algorithms to be used.  
4. Alternative designs considered but not selected, including a short reason why it wasn't chosen.  
5. Other relevant concerns relevant to the org, like data security, scalability, etc.

### Lifecycle of a Design Doc

1. Creating and iterating the Design Doc. It's best if the juniors write the doc while the seniors review it.
2. Review the doc as a team, encouraging everyone to participate and ask questions, preferably in the context of a meeting in person.
3. Invite people outside the team to review the Design Doc. Keep this lightweight as much as possible.  
4. Crafting the solution and updating the Design Doc as needed.  
5. Reviewing and learning from past Design Docs.
