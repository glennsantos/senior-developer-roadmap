## Retrospectives

### Purpose

Plan ways to increase product quality and improve processes based on experiences in the previous sprint.

### Steps

1. In a shared document, write down the following headers:
   + What worked well
   + What could be better
   + What will we improve 
2. If you've done a retrospective previously, review the results of that briefly.
3. Under "What worked well", members write down their responses. Do the same for "What could be better"
   + It usually helps to construct a timeline of important milestones during the sprint to help recall events.
4. Group similar ideas together.
5. Discuss each answer briefly as a team.
6. Under "What will we improve", brainstorm next steps to improve problem areas discussed.
7. Discuss these steps, grouping similar ideas together and prioritizing as needed.
8. Afterwards, assign directly-responsible individuals and due dates, as needed.


## Post-Mortems

### Purpose

Understand and study all the failures encountered after a project has been finished, in order to prevent these issues from happening again in the future.

> Retrospectives are done to deliver improvements while the project is still ongoing, whereas post-mortems can only be used to improve succeeding projects.

### Steps

Use the steps for retrospectives above, but with the scope covering the whole project instead.
