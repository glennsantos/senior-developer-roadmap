## ⚗️ Estimation & Scope

Let's get this out of the way: estimating tasks is hard. While you get more confident as you gain more experience estimating, the changing world of tech also means that last year's estimates aren't necessarily the same as the estimates for this year's project.

### Scoping Tips 
1. Scope down your tasks into something that can be done in a day, more or less.  
2. Create precise task titles to avoid ambiguity. This is especially important if more than one person will be working on the task over time.  
3. Use the acceptance criteria and definition of done to populate the task list.  
4. Don't forget to include important secondary tasks such as writing tests, documentation, database migrations, etc.  

### Estimation Tip
1. Compare this task to previous tasks you've done before that are similar, then use that as your baseline.  
2. Consider any dependencies that might be needed to proceed with the task. These can include:  
   - Domain knowledge or research needed to fully understand the requirements.  
   - PoCs to build to understand the solution better.  
   - Prerequisite code to build/import that's a dependency for the task, ex. a registration system before building the login page.  
   - Skills needed by the team to build the solution.  
3. Always remember that the estimates are relative to each other and should not be absolute figures, like man hours. The usual method is using story points in a Fibonacci sequence which demostrates that larger tasks are often an order of magnitude bigger than previous sizes.

### Estimation Tools

#### Planning Poker

Team members estimate a task but only reveal their choice once everyone has picked theirs. If there's a consensus and minimal variance in the estimate, the most common estimate picked is used for the task. Otherwise, discuss and repeat the estimation until you reach a consensus.

#### T-shirt Sizing

This follows the same process as Planning Poker but uses shirt sizes for estimates instead of numbers. It's faster, simpler and makes the estimation process easier.
