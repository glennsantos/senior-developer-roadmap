## ‚öóÔ∏è Estimation & Scope

Let's get this out of the way: estimating tasks is hard. Thankfully, estimation and scoping are both done as a team so you can get help from those with more experience. Over time, you'll be more confident with your estimates. 

### Scoping

1. Break down epics / features into user stories, with each story creating value for a user.  
2. Stories are then further broken down into tasks, with each task being a code change that can be unit tested individually.
3. Use the *acceptance criteria* and *definition of done* to populate the task list.  
4. A tasks that just take a few hours don't need to be broken down further.  
5. Combine tasks that are similar or very small to limit overhead costs.
6. Developers should be able to complete several tasks per day, and several stories per week.  
7. Create precise task titles to avoid ambiguity. This is especially important if more than one person will be working on the task over time.  
8. Don't forget to include important secondary tasks such as writing tests, documentation, database migrations, etc.  

*Examples of tasks:*  
* Creating tests  
* Creating documentation  
* Developing spikes / PoCs / experiments using new technology   
* Tackling an edge case  
* Refactoring and optimizing the solution  

### Estimation Tips
1. Compare this task to similar tasks you've done before, then use the previous estimate as your baseline.  
2. Consider any dependencies that might be needed to proceed with the task. These can include:  
   - **Domain knowledge** or research needed to fully understand the requirements.  
   - **PoCs** to build to understand the solution better.  
   - **Prerequisite code** to build/import that's a dependency for the task, ex. a registration system before building the login page.  
   - **Skills** needed by the team to build the solution.  
3. Always remember that estimates are relative to each other and should not be absolute figures, like manhours. The usual method is using story points in a Fibonacci sequence which demostrates that larger tasks are often an order of magnitude bigger than the preceding smaller task.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è Planning Poker

Team members create estimates for a story but only reveal their choice once everyone has created theirs. If there's a consensus and minimal variance in the estimate, the most common estimate is applied to the task. Otherwise, discuss then repeat the estimation until you reach a consensus.

### üëï T-shirt Sizing

This follows the same process as Planning Poker but uses shirt sizes for estimates instead of numbers. It's faster, simpler and makes the estimation process easier.
