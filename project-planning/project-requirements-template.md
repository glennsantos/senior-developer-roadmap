## 📦 Product Requirements Template

The PRT helps everyone in the team have a good understanding of:  

1.👪 The 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 the app will serve.  
2. 🚧 The customer 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 it solves.  
3. 🏗️ The actual 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 to be implemented.  
4. 💯 The 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 used to determine if the solution succeeded in solving the problem.  

In this way, everyone in the team will know how each piece of code fits into the over all solution. Each member now has a common understanding of the problem and solution, so discussions of edge cases, scaling issues, and other potentially nasty problems can move forward smoothly.

### Target Customer

Usually the product manager, business analyst or marketing team handles this. Don't be afraid to ask them tough questions about their intended user because it will help you deliver a better solution for the customer.

Especially important is to get them to rank the types of users, which will act as a tiebreaker if a feature is required by one set of users, but is opposed by another set.

Documents created when looking for the target customer:  
👥 User Personas  
🏞️ Customer Journey  
🔦 Customer Insights   

### Business Value

On the other side, finance or management will require resources to craft the solution suggested. Discuss how you will go about:  

👷 Staffing the team who will create the solution  
💰 Customer acquisition costs  
🏦 Revenue estimates  
☣️ Potential risks of the solution  

### Success Metrics

Common ways to measure success

* Measure the customer impact: % growth in customers, % reduction in churn, etc  
* Measure the business impact: % reduction in costs, % increase in revenue  


### Press Release as MVP

Read the part of the template about the [Press Release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAPT8b2g1JQdoNcc9ssahGgWUp96X8_BWJ59zA7_E40/edit#heading=h.vyo3sbssdj44) to better understand how it's made. Basically, you want to focus on the value of the feature to the customer, not the business. This will also serve as a guide for fleshing out the features you need to build.

### User Stories 

Finally, map out the features into Stories to add to your backlog. Make sure to use the “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]” format, as well as tag the importance of the story, whether it's a must-have, nice-to-have, or optional.
