If you prefer something actionable, [jump to the checklist version here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KFsSw723NudDQOQhCvOaip9JjPUoiEdl5bg6bKTC14/edit?usp=sharing). _TIP: Go to File > Make a Copy so you can have your own checkable copy of the checklist._

We also have a mentorship program where we help developers become leaders. [Come join us](https://tally.so/r/3leK5w)!
