### ðŸŒŒ Self-Awareness

There's internal self-awareness: how clearly you see your own values, passions, aspirations, fit with our environment, reactions (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses), and impact on others. 

There's also external self-awareness: understanding how other people view you, in terms of those same factors listed above.
