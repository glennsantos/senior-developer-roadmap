## Leadership Qualities

I'm highlighting these qualities since I believe becoming a successful leader requires all of these traits.

### Self-Awareness

### ðŸ”Ž Transparency

Transparency means you have open and honest communications with your team.

#### Benefits

* Faster communication
* Increased employee happiness and productivity
* Stronger work culture
* Better customer relationships

#### How to do this

1. Initiate open conversations by first sharing things about yourself so that others are encouraged to do the same.
2. Recount a failed decision and what you learned from it.
3. Encourage a culture that does not punish people for bringing up failures.  
4. Host AskMeAnything sessions so the team can get to know you better.
5. Avoid sugar coating bad news.
6. Be straightforward while still being kind.
7. When sharing decisions, also share the reasons behind it.
8. Make information easily accessible to every team member. It should be visible and well as easy to find.
