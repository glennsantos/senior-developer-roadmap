## Leadership Qualities

I'm highlighting these qualities since I believe becoming a successful leader requires all of these traits.

### ðŸŒŒ Self-Awareness

There's internal self-awareness: how clearly you see your own values, passions, aspirations, fit with our environment, reactions (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses), and impact on others. 

There's also external self-awareness: understanding how other people view you, in terms of those same factors listed above.

#### Benefits

* Increased confidence
* Increased creativity
* Better decision making
* Better communications


#### Recommended Activities

1. Seek frequent critical feedback from your bosses, same-level peers, team.
2. Seek feedback from loving critics, people who can be honest with you and have your best interests in mind.
3. Cross-check any difficult or surprising feedback you get with other people.
4. Keep an open mind with regards to the feedback you receive.
5. Write down your core values so you know what drives your decisions.
6. Communicate these values to your direct reports.
7. Adjust your behavior based on your self-assessments and feedback from others.
8. Instead of asking yourself "why" and rationalizing an action, ask yourself "what" so you can be objective and more solution-oriented.
   + ex. Instead of asking yourself, "Why did I say that?", instead ask "What could have I said instead?"

### ðŸ”Ž Transparency

Transparency means you have open and honest communications with your team.

#### Benefits

* Faster team communication
* Increased employee happiness and productivity
* Stronger work culture
* Better customer relationships

#### Recommended Activities

1. Initiate open conversations by first sharing things about yourself so that others are encouraged to do the same.
2. Recount a failed decision and what you learned from it.
3. Encourage a culture that does not punish people for bringing up failures.  
4. Host AskMeAnything sessions so the team can get to know you better.
5. Avoid sugar coating bad news.
6. Be straightforward while still being kind.
7. When sharing decisions, also share the reasons behind it.
8. Make information easily accessible to every team member. It should be visible and well as easy to find.
