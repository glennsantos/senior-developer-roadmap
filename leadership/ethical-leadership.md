### How to be an Ethical Leader

1. Know you own values and principles. Make them visible to your team by posting them in public.
2. Lead by example. Ethical leaders should have the same expectations for themselves as for those that work for them. 
3. Bring up potential issues of certain decisions, even if this means slowing things down or generating more work. 
4. Act with fairness. Support meritocracy and fair treatment of every individual, regardless of status, ethnicity, age, or any other potential factor of discrimination.
5. Assume full responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of your team.
6. Show up and speak for your team. Ethical leaders are present in good and bad times, develop their teams, and defend others when needed.
7. Keep open lines of communications with the team. Ask your team for constant honest feedback about your behavior so you can course correct if needed.
8. Acknowledge your team members' successes and celebrate them.
9. Help your team members be the best version of themselves, even if it means you might lose them to another opportunity.
10. Address deviations from the ethical code directly and quickly. Doing so helps build consistency and credibility, and avoids confusion and doubts about accepted behaviors.
11. Admit mistakes and share a recovery plan if needed. Apologize, find ways to solve the issue, and share all possible recovery plans with stakeholders.
12. Tell the truth. Don't offer promises or lie about future outcomes like a possible promotion or a contingent approval of additional budget.
13. Deliver on your promises. Also, be honest and transparent about what you're offering.
14. Only recommend something if it's worth it for the customer, even if it's not for the company's best interests.
15. Manage your stress levels effectively. This means relieving stress in a positive manner, instead of offloading it to your team.
