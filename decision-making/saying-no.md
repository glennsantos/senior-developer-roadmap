## ðŸ™… Saying No

### Who hates saying no?
* People pleasers
* Helpful people
* People afraid to look incompetent
* Perfectionists

### Tips:
1. Gather data so you learn how requests affect your emotions and productivity.  
   * Take note of how many times you say yes, no or maybe to a request.
   * Notice and record how each of those requests made you feel.
   * Document your energy level and your calendar.
2. Be intentional when saying yes. Notice the kinds of requests that align with your values or make you feel good.
3. Before you say yes, pause. Consider the negative and positive consequences of accepting or declining a request.
4. Learn the art of the **soft no** aka a not-at-this-time no. A soft no might be easier for a recovering people pleaser. Say no, thank them and append it with: "but I don't have the bandwidth for this at this time."
5. Once get the hang of it, start saying no much more clearly so no one is left wondering about your response. Of course, still thanking them for the request.
6. If you'd like to add an explanation, especially when saying no to a superior, keep it short and sweet. 
7. You can also offer alternatives to the requester.  
   * Reschedule it to a later date.
   * Refer them to another person who can help.
   * Reduce the scope of the task to match your availability.
   * Ask them which other tasks they can deprioritize for this one.
