## 🔁 Tradeoffs

### Tips:
1. Learn to view most decisions as tradeoffs, not good versus bad.
2. Visualize the tradeoff in a graph or diagram to make the decision easier.
3. Revisit your tradeoffs once in a while. Once a year or every quarter maybe.
4. Keep in mind that weighing tradeoffs doesn't mean halting the decision process. Sometimes, you need to make a decision quickly without it.

### Tradeoff Framing

*Format*:
> X has these advantages, BUT has these disadvantages ... In the context Z, X is likely a good choice.

1. Advantages
2. Disadvantages
3. Contexts where it is the right choice
4. Uncertainties

* Usually, advantages and disadvantages are in the realm of scope, cost and time. Examples:
  - Long-term vs short-term benefits.
  - Development effort vs User effort (some features are hard to make but benefit users)
  - Quality vs story completion
  - Rapid development vs maintainability
