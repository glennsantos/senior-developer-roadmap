## 🔁 Tradeoffs

### Tradeoff Framing

*Format*:
> X has these 𝘢𝘥𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴, BUT has these 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘢𝘥𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 ... In the 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵 Z, X is likely a good choice. 

1. Advantages
2. Disadvantages
3. Contexts where it is the right choice

* Usually, advantages and disadvantages are in the realm of scope, cost and time. Examples:
  - Long-term vs short-term benefits.
  - Development effort vs User effort (some features are hard to make but benefit users)
  - Quality vs story completion
  - Rapid development vs maintainability

### Tips:
1. Learn to view most decisions as tradeoffs, not good versus bad.
2. Visualize the tradeoff in a graph or diagram to make the decision easier.

3. Revisit your tradeoffs once in a while. Once a year or every quarter maybe.
4. Keep in mind that weighing tradeoffs doesn't mean halting the decision process. Sometimes, you need to make a decision quickly without it.

### Framework for Deciding to use New Technology

🔳 Have I exhausted all my usual solutions to the problems before using a new unfamiliar technology?  
🔳 Does this new tech address the requirements of the project? Don't choose it just because it's novel and exciting.  
🔳 Are you choosing this tech because it yields a correct solution? Or are you choosing it because it's simpler to code or has better performance? It's easier to fix performance and to make code simpler later versus fixing an incorrect solution.  
🔳 Is this technology here to stay? How popular is it? Has it been around for a few years? How actively maintained is it?  
🔳 Is this technology something my team likes to work with? Does it match their skill levels? Never underestimate motivation for driving people to learn new technologies.
