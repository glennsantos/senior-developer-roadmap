## ⚡ Decisiveness

*To be decisive:*
1. Accept that the future is unknown. 🔮 Stop focusing on outcomes.   
2. Keep your decision process simple.  
   ⏲️ Set a time limit for research and debate to avoid "analysis paralysis"
   🔢 Limit your options to reduce information overload.
   ⚖️ Weigh the best- and worst-case scenarios.
3. Decide based on logic, facts, and your personal values, not based on feelings and emotions, ex. 😖 FOMO, fear of loss, disappointing someone, etc.  
4. Embrace experimentation 🧪 to overcome the fear of failure. TIP: practice saying "no".  
5. Pursue growth, not perfection. 🌳 Learn from your mistakes instead of self-criticizing wrong decisions.
