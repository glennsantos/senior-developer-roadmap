## Decisiveness

*To be decisive:*
1. Stop focusing on outcomes. Accept that the future is unknown.
2. Keep your decision process simple. 
   * Set a time limit for research and debate to avoid "[analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)"
   * Limit your options to reduce information overload.
   * Weigh the best- and worst-case scenarios.
3. Do not decide based on feelings and emotions, ex. [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), fear of loss, disappointing someone, etc.
4. Embrace experimentation to overcome the fear of failure. TIP: practice saying "no".
5. Pursue growth, not perfection. Learn from your mistakes instead of self-criticizing wrong decisions.
