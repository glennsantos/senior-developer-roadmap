## 💭 Mental Models

## ↩️ Inversion

Ask how you might achieve a terrible outcome, and let that guide our decision-making by avoiding it.
> Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮
1. Assume that what you’re trying to prove is either true or false, then show what else would have to be true.
2. Think deeply about what you want to avoid and then see what options are left over.

1. Identify the problem
2. Define your objective
3. Identify the forces that support change towards your objective
4. Identify the forces that impede change towards the objective
5. Strategize a solution! This may involve both augmenting or adding to the forces in step 3, and reducing or eliminating the forces in step 4.

## 🎲 Probabilistic thinking

Probabilistic thinking is using some tools of math and logic to estimate the likelihood of any specific outcome.
> Probability estimates are more often wrong on the "over-optimistic" side than the "under-optimistic" side

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨:
1. Roughly identify what matters
2. Come up with a sense of the odds. Use 𝗕𝗮𝘆𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, assigning probabilities to outcomes based on similar past situations.
3. Check your assumptions
   * Watching out for 𝗙𝗮𝘁-𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲𝘀, wherein common outcomes do not represent the average.
   * Check for 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗺𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, the probability that your probability estimates themselves are any good.
4. Make the decision
   * Consider 𝗨𝗽𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆, seek out situations that have good odds of offering opportunities
   * Never take a risk that will do you in completely
   * Create scenarios where randomness and uncertainty are your friends, not your enemies.

### Causation vs. Correlation

Trying to invert the relationship can help you sort through claims to determine if you are dealing with true causation or just correlation.

Whenever correlation is imperfect, extremes will soften over time
> Rhe best will always appear to get worse and the worst will appear to get better,

We often mistakenly attribute a specific policy or treatment as the cause of an effect, when the change in the extreme groups would have happened anyway.
> Solution: Create control groups.

## 🧱 First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking helps clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them.
* Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible.
* The real power of first principles thinking is moving away from random change and into choices that have a real possibility of success.

𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥 𝙞𝙣 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙:
1. Use 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴. 
   * Explain the origins of your ideas.
   * Challenge assumptions.
   * Look for evidence.
   * Consider alternative perspectives.
   * Examine implications.
   * Question the original questions.
2. Use 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝘆𝘀
   * Ask "why" repeatedly to separate reliable knowledge from assumption, until you land on a "what" or "how".
   * If your "whys" result in a statement of falsifiable fact, you have hit a first principle.

## 🔗 Second-Order Thinking

Second-order thinking requires us to not only consider not just your actions and its immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well.
> Evaluate the most likely effects and their most likely consequences, checking our understanding of what the typical results of our actions will be.

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨:
1. Second-order consequences are magnified the more people are affected by the outcome.
2. Weigh long-term interests over immediate gains.
   * Going for the immediate payoff in our interactions with people, unless they are a win-win, almost always guarantees that interaction will be a one-off.
3. Construct effective arguments by proposing second-order benefits, not just the immediate effects.
   * But watch out for the Slippery Slope Effect

## 💭 Thought Experiments

Thought experiments tell you about the limits of what you know and the limits of what you should attempt.
> It lets us do things in our heads we cannot do in real life
> Use thought experiments to reduce the role of chance in decisions.

Where to use:
* Imagining physical impossibilities
* Re-imagining history
* Intuiting the non-intuitive
* Exploring ethical and moral issues
  
𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨:
1. Ask a question
2. Conduct background research
3. Construct hypothesis
4. Test with thought experiments
5. Analyze outcomes and draw conclusions
6. Compare to hypothesis and adjust accordingly

### Necessity and Sufficiency

The gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control.

The set of conditions necessary to become successful is a part of the set that is sufficient to become successful. But the sufficient set itself is far larger than the necessary set.

## 🖍️ Occam’s Razor

Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones. 
> Make decisions more confidently by basing them on the explanation that has the fewest moving parts.

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨:
1. Opt for the simple to make decisions based on how things really are
2. If something cannot be broken down any further, we must deal with it as it is.

----

## Hanlon’s Razor

Do not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by human error.
> When we see something we don’t like happen and which seems wrong, we assume it’s intentional.

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨:
1. Assume positive intent
2. List the motives that require the least amount of energy to execute (such as ignorance or laziness). These are more likely to occur than one that requires active malice.

----

## 🗺️ The Map is not the Territory

Maps are:
- reductions of what they represent
- a snapshot of a point in time
- subjective to the author's point of view

𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥 𝙞𝙣 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙:
1. If reality has changed, the map must change.
2. Consider them in the context of their creator and why they were created
3. The more people know which map you’re using on them, the lower the chance the map can predict their behavior.

----

## 🎓 Circle of Competence

Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes.

In your circle of competence, you:
* Have multiple solutions to every problem.
* Can eliminate bad solutions quickly.
* Make decisions quickly and relatively accurately.
* Know the knowns and unknowns and can distinguish between the two.

Building a circle of competence takes years of experience, of making mistakes, and of actively seeking out better methods of practice and thought.

𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥 𝙞𝙣 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙:
1. Have a learning mindset to maintain your circle of competence. Be curious, honestly record and review your perfromance, and accept external feedback humbly.
2. To successfully operate outside your circle of competence
    * Learn the basics.
    * Consult someone who is has a strong circle of competence in that area.
    * Use mental models to augment your understanding.

### Falsifiability

Falsification is the opposite of verification
> You must try to show the theory is incorrect, and if you fail to do so, you actually strengthen it.

Applying the filter of falsifiability helps us sort through which theories are more robust.
