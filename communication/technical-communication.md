## ðŸ¤– Technical Communication

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Make technical documents easily accessible and understandable by your target audience, who can be technical or non-technical.

### Examples of Technical Content You Might Create
ðŸ“œ API Documentation  
ðŸ”· Architecture Diagrams  
ðŸ“’ Technical Training Manuals  
ðŸ’¼ Project Proposals  

### How To Create Better Technical Content

#### Consider Your Audience
* When creating for developers, use well-known technical terms as a shortcut to getting your point across.
* When creating for experienced non-tech professionals, bridge understanding by using analogies to concepts in their profession. Example: Compare your authentication process with the due diligence done by legal.
* When creating for end users, make explanations as simple as possible. [Read more here.](https://github.com/glennsantos/senior-developer-roadmap/blob/main/communication/eli5-for-tech-concepts.md).

#### Consider UX
* Some information is best served in an interactive media. For example, implement an OpenAPI interface like Swagger for API documentation versus just a text document.
* Add animated images when explaining processes. This [load balancer primer](https://samwho.dev/load-balancing/) is a great example of that.
* If you want something distributed widely, you can stick to a simple, interoperable format like PDF which is readable with almost any device.
* For formal documents, use the standard document structure to help professional go through it quickly.
* Long form content needs to be split up into manageable parts. Use headers, lists and if possible, a table of contents that links to each section.

#### Consider Collaboration
* Technical content often needs to be updated frequently. Consider creating in a platform that promotes this, like a wiki or via shared documents.
* Choose also a format that allows for collaboration so people can provide their feedback and propose changes, such as using markdown documents stored in a git repository.
* Since some technical content is confidential, pick a platform that lets you restrict and maybe even audit access to the documents.
* Choose a platform that helps you and others create that content easily. There are many tools for easily building diagrams, app interfaces, mind maps, and other kinds of content.
