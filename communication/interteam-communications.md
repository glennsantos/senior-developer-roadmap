## 🚻 Interteam Communications
Working with your own team is already a challenge at times, but what if you need to work with people from different backgrounds, professions, cultures, and nationalities? Use what you've learned so far about [listening](https://github.com/glennsantos/senior-developer-roadmap/blob/main/communication/listening.md) and [mindful communication](https://github.com/glennsantos/senior-developer-roadmap/blob/main/communication/mindful-communication.md) of course!

### *Start on the Right Foot*

#### 🎩 Get Top Level Buy In  
Prior to starting the project, get executive or management support, if possible, to help smooth out collaboration issues. If they can join team meetings once in a while, even better

#### 📛 Introduce Your Team  
For the first getting-to-know-you meeting, introduce the people on your side who will be part of the cross-functional team. Talk about what they will contribute and their expertise.

#### 🎖️ Choose a Project Leader  
Create leadership guidelines from the start to clarify decision-making. Also, make sure that the leader you choose is comfortable assigning tasks to more experienced team members.

#### 🚩 Create a Team Charter  
Introducing a team charter is a great way to foster inter-departmental teamwork, especially when joining a new team or company. It provides context for your team’s goals and opens up the conversation for future projects and collaboration. The charter should cover the team’s mission and objectives, team roles, and expectations for effective collaboration.

### *Agree On How To Collaborate*

#### 📱 Choose a Common Communications Medium  
To keep everyone on the same page, ensure that everyone agrees on what chat app to use for the project. You can stick to the defaults of email for official communications and phone calls for really urgent matters.

#### 🧮 Choose a Project Management Tool  
Having a common task board or list will ensure easy collaboration and transparency about the work being done. Pick a tool that's easy to use and familiar.

#### 🗳️ Establish a Transparent Decision-Making Process  
A clear decision-making process is crucial for accountability and team buy-in. Team members should know what decisions they can make independently and who to report to for a second opinion. Guidelines can be set to steer the group’s thinking on more complex decisions and to prioritize common goals.

#### ⏭️ Build A Timeline  
Estimate the project timeline and the time commitment required from each team member before assigning them to the project. Allow them to assess their availability and ensure they can commit to the project.

### *Align Regularly*

#### 📻 Set Regular Meetings  
Create a regular cadence when each team will report to the whole. Syncing up this way ensures the project chugs along smoothly and any conflicts are resolved quickly. 

#### 🤲 Promote Transparency  
Encouraging a culture of open collaboration starts with you. Be willing to share failures and challenges, as well as asking for help from others. Others will follow your lead and share their own knowledge and roadblocks.

#### 🤗 Get Some Face Time In  
Sometimes, meeting in person is the best way to improve your interteam collaboration. If the logistics of this is a challenge, you can still opt for camera-on video calls to have the high-bandwidth communication that gestures and facial expressions provide.

#### 🌍 Rotate Meeting Schedules For Other Timezones  
Many teams work in different timezones, even those in the same country. Consider rotating meeting times to accommodate folks from other countries or with different schedules.

### *Communicate Mindfully*

#### 🔤 Talk In a Common Language  
For teams that cross cultural boundaries, establish which language to use when messaging and meeting. The default nowadays seems to be English but feel free to pick another language that each team member is comfortable in. 

#### 🙇 Respect Perspectives  
Come into discussions with a mindset of collaboration and respect. Some conflicts might arise but keep discussions professional and respectful. These discussions might even yield new ideas that will benefit each team.

#### 🏳️ Resolve Conflicts Proactively   
Conflicts are bound to arise in cross-team communication. When they do, resolve them proactively and collaboratively to ensure they don't escalate.
