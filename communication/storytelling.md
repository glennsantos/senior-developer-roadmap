## Storytelling
> Stories encourage personal connection; they’re an effective method for engaging an audience and helping them to remember the content we’re sharing.

### When to Add Stories

* 🪁 **Feature Planning** They're called "user stories" for a reason, after all.

* 🎡 **Change Requests** Implementing something new can be a challenge if you don't show people how your new process will help their daily work.

* 🏟️ **Product Demos** Perfect for illustrating how people will actually use your software in a context they understand.

* 🏕️ **Retrospectives** Make your challenges during development relatable through a solid narrative.

* ⛳ **Meetings With Management** Whether you're reporting progress or pitching an idea, stories help leaders relate to your points better.

* 🎢 **Onboarding** Help new joiners feel at ease by talking about your own experiences during your first week with the company.

* 💺 **Performance Evaluations** Sharing direct feedback goes down easier if you build rapport with the other party.

* 💈 **Knowledge Transfer Sessions** One of the best ways to teach is through a story.

> Being able to articulate a vision, or an opinion, in precise and concise writing, is critical to influencing. If you want to grow to Staff or Principal levels, you need to develop the ability to put forth a narrative.

### Where to Include Stories

1. **Introduction**  
A good story or experience can be a good segue to your main topic.
* Example: When writing your coding style guide, start with a story about how having a style guide helped you become a better programmer, and the challenges you faced using it the first time.
 
2. **Illustration**  
Insert a story about how to apply something you're teaching or how they might encounter the idea in real life. This makes it more relatable.
* Example: During your documentation of a new feature, write a narrative about how people might use that feature to help in their work.

3. **Interaction**  
Invite the reader to step into the shoes of the protagonist of a story. How do they feel about it? What would they change about it? 
* Example: Craft a day-in-the-life story about someone using your new deployment process. Let other developers step into the role of DevOps and solicit feedback.

4. **Conclusion**  
End with a story and a question to keep your audience engaged and thinking about your topic.
* Example: Finish your performance review of a junior engineer with a short retelling of your own struggles being a new developer in a team.

### Storytelling Guidelines
* **Choose a story that fits your audience.** Talk to your audience and use the techniques and language they understand best.

* **Choose a provocative yet informative title.** It has to be intriguing without misleading. You're also upfront about your main topic so as not to waste anyone's time.

* **Keep the story simple and concise.** You're here to make a point, not to monologue.

* **Bridge the story to your main point.** Explain how the story relates to the topic at hand. 
TIP: If you remove the story and your message loses its meaning, then you've used the story to effectively show your point.

* **Include visuals.** It's a good narrative break for you and it also maintains engagement with your audience.

* **Add humor, if you can pull it off.** In a world of memes, this sounds easy but make sure that you have your comedic timing in place. And make sure the humor is both kosher and isn't stale. 

* **Add a good summary at the end.** Your purpose is to get a message across and repeating that when you conclude helps cement it in your audience's minds.
  
* **Practice.** Write stories regularly. Rehearse your talks in front of the mirror to convey the right tone and body language.
