### Strategies for Overcommunication

1. Keep your purpose for overcommunicating top of mind. This helps you stay focused in your messaging.
2. Make sure messages and feedback are straightforward and concise. 
3. Opt for shorter, focused, more frequent check-ins. 
4. Check in with your team members in casual settings. 
5. Mix up your modes of communication. Standup meetings can be for progress reports, chat can be for quick questions.
6. Don‚Äôt wait to share news‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs bad news. If your employees trust that you will be honest and transparent with them, they will be less stressed and better equipped to move through change effectively.
7. If you‚Äôre sending a communication about that meeting, make sure it happens close to the meeting itself.
8. At the end of your meeting, have goals and next steps written out and accessible to everyone.
9. Documenting your communication makes sure you know what you said, who you said it to, and when it was said. This is important to keep everyone accountable and iterate on your processes for greater efficiency in the future.
