## Mindful Communication

### 🦻 Listen Actively
* Practice active listening by focusing on the speaker's words, body language, and tone of voice. 
* Avoid interrupting or assuming you know what the other person is saying.
* Put your activities aside and totally be with the person who’s talking.

### 💝 Show Understanding and Non-Judgment
* When people tell you their issues, the first thing to say is, “I understand” or “I see what you mean.” It gives them a sense of comfort that their words and feelings are relatable.
* There are always two sides to the story, and neither one of them is necessarily right or wrong. 
* Imagine yourself in the experience of the other person, which helps cultivate understanding.

### 🎙️ Practice Speaking Kindly
* The first response must relate to the speaker. “I understand” — as mentioned earlier — can be a good place to start. 
* Then we can ask the person how they feel about it, what they are going to do, or ask them to elaborate.
* Remain kind and compassionate with other people during communication.

### 🤲 Let Go of Results
* Not taking things personally and responding in a non-aggressive way are good baby steps toward accomplishing this goal.

### 🗳️ Be Open to Feedback
* Be willing to receive feedback from the other person and use it as an opportunity for growth and learning.
