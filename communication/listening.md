## 🦻 Listening

### Active Listening 
> Active listening is a communication technique that involves fully engaging with the speaker and demonstrating that you are present and attentive to their message. It involves not only hearing the words being spoken but also understanding the speaker's perspective, feelings, and intentions.

## How to be an Active Listener

### 📵 Remove Distractions
* Find a quiet space where you can focus on the conversation without interruptions.
* Turn off notifications on your devices and close unnecessary windows or tabs.
* Avoid doing other things, like checking your email or social media, during the conversation.
* Be honest; if you aren’t able to focus at the moment, pick another time.

### 🧘‍♂️ Listen with Your Ears, Eyes and Body
* Listen actively to the speaker's words and tone of voice. 
* Pay attention to their body language if you can see them on video.
* Make eye contact, nod your head, and use facial expressions to show that you are listening.
* Use video conferencing to help maintain a sense of connection and nonverbal cues that can be lost in audio-only conversations.

### 🔕 Avoid Interrupting
* Try to focus on what the speaker is saying instead of formulating a response.
* Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts before responding. 
* Take a deep, mindful breath before responding.
* Respond, do not react.

### 💗 Practice Empathy
* Listen with openness and willingness to understand the other person’s point of view.
* Be open and curious, and try to understand their perspective.
* Notice your feelings, thoughts, and body sensations when they come up. What are they telling you?
* Acknowledge their emotions and respond with compassion.
  
### 💭 Engage Your Memory
* Remember names: the name of the speaker, any one close to them and anyone they mention that seem important.
* Recall topics you've talked about before that are relevant and important to the speaker.

### 🖐️ Ask the Right Questions
* Ask open-ended questions that invite the speaker to communicate their point of view.
* If something is unclear, ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand the speaker's point of view.
* After the speaker has finished speaking, reflect back on what they have said and clarify any points that are unclear.
