## ‚ùî Asking Questions

### Types of Questions to Ask

* üì¨ Open-ended Questions
> These questions allow the speaker to provide a detailed response, and can help to encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings more fully. Examples include "Can you tell me more about that?" or "How did you feel about that?"

* üîé Clarifying Questions
> These questions are used to ensure that you have fully understood what the speaker is saying. Examples include "Can you clarify what you mean by that?" or "Can you explain that in more detail?"

* üèïÔ∏è Reflective Questions
> These questions encourage the speaker to reflect on their thoughts and feelings. Examples include "How do you feel about that?" or "What do you think might have caused that?"

* üíó Empathetic Questions 
> These questions demonstrate empathy and understanding of the speaker's perspective. Examples include "That must have been difficult for you, how did you cope?" or "What can I do to support you?"

* üß© Problem-Solving Questions 
> These questions are used to explore potential solutions to a problem or issue. Examples include "What options do you think we have?" or "What steps can we take to address this issue?"

* ‚úã Follow-up Questions
> These questions signal to your conversation partner that you are listening, care, and want to know more. People interacting with a partner who asks lots of follow-up questions tend to feel respected and heard.

### Tip for Asking Great Questions

1. Do a question-storming session. List all your questions first before asking them aloud. Then pick the ones that are truly worth answering.
2. Provide some sort of explanation of why you're asking your questions and how you will use the answers.
3.  Whenever you ask the presenter a question, never start with an apology.
4.  People are more forthcoming when you ask questions in a casual way, rather than in a buttoned-up, official tone. 
5. Ask ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow might we‚Ä¶?‚Äù What if you weren‚Äôt limited to the current way of thinking about a problem? How might you achieve a future where two expected options weren‚Äôt mutually exclusive?
6.  Keep your questions short.
7. If you are in a tense negotiation or are dealing with people who tend to keep their cards close to their chest, closed questions work better, especially if they are framed correctly.
8. In difficult conversations, research shows the person being asked will respond with more information if you just begin with the hard questions.
9. People are more willing to reveal sensitive information when questions are asked in a decreasing order of intrusiveness.
10. If the goal is to build relationships, opening with less sensitive questions and escalating slowly seems to be more effective.
11. Draw information from others by asking questions as if you already know the answer and simply want to hear more details about it. 
12. Ask questions that encourage exploring emotions and ideas will lead to more fruitful conversations. 
13. Try to limit the number of questions you ask during meetings to 2. In addition, be sure to ask the most crucial question you have last.
14. If you suspect the answer to a question you want to ask will be negative ‚Äì for instance, that report you need isn‚Äôt going to be done on time ‚Äì frame your question in a negative way.
15. Understand and accept that a ‚Äòno‚Äô in response to a question framed in a particular way at one point in time doesn‚Äôt mean that it will be a ‚Äòno‚Äô forever.
16. Ask for the reaction you want. People don‚Äôt necessarily ask for the reaction they want. Be specific about what you are after from the other person.
17. You may find that the conversation prompts follow-up questions or answers to questions you planned to ask before voicing them. Try to relax, and don‚Äôt think every question-asking instance has to be formal.
18. Pausing to listen between answers gives you time to think about what was said and ask better follow-up questions.
