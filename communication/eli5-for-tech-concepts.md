## üñçÔ∏è ELI5 for Tech Concepts
> ELI5 refers to "explain like I'm five (years old)", teaching an idea such that even a kindergartener can understand it. Of course, you don't think the person is actually five. Look at it this way: the person was absent during class when the concept was explained by the professor at university.

As a senior developer, you should be able to explain complicated technical ideas to junior and non-technical team members in simple, easy-to-understand language. Having this superpower makes collaboration and communication so much easier within and between teams.

### *Steps to becoming an ELI5 Master*

#### üß† Grok the Idea
 - If you need to brush up on the topic, fire up your browser to look up and review the concept once again. 
 - If you feel like you don't grasp the idea enough to explain it, be honest with your audience and maybe even tell them that you'll get back to them after you do your research. There is no shame in it.
 - Practice explaining the concept to yourself before trying to explain it to others, if you have time. This is similar to [Rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) about code.

#### üö™ Read the Room
 - If your audience are junior developers, they need to learn some of the jargon to do their job. Don't be afraid to sprinkle in a few technical terms in your explanation so they can ask about them if it's new to them, or look them up on their own time.
 - If your audience are experienced professionals in a non-technical field, you don't need to ELI5 it too much. Maybe ELI18 it, with way less technical jargon.
 - Otherwise, ELI5 is in full effect. The next steps will help you here. 

#### üìå Make The Complex Simple
 - Break down big ideas into their component parts. For complicated processes, go through them step by step. For complex systems, group component ideas by roles, functionality, or some other category.
 - Use analogies and stories to compare the technical idea to something familiar to your listener. For example when explaining git to an accountant, you can compare it to a general ledger, where the commits are like transactions.
 - As mentioned before, keep technical terms at a minimum if possible. If you do need to use jargon, explain it in terms that your audience can understand.
 - Of course, avoid obscure and complex words as well, since those often just add confusion. Keep sentences short and simple as well.
 - Keep the tone conversational and friendly as well, which also helps the other person/s focus on what you're saying instead of how you're saying it.

#### üìä Use Visual Aids
 - Find some visual aids online, such as diagrams, charts, and graphs, to help you bridge understanding with your audience.
 - Lacking that, use [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or a [virtual whiteboard](https://webwhiteboard.com/) to create your own visuals.
 - Gestures and drawing in the air also work! 
  
#### üèûÔ∏è Focus on the Big Picture
 - Non-technical people are usually interested in the practical implications of a technical concept. 
 - Try to focus on the big picture, explain how the concept affects their work or life, and what benefits it offers.

#### ü§≤ Be Open to Feedback
 - Don't worry if you don't get nodding heads the first time around. Listen to their feedback and adjust your approach as needed.
 - Practice ELI5-ing with other developers at the same level and get their input, especially those who teach regularly.
