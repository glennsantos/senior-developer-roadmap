## Async Communication
> Async communication covers all methods of communication that aren't real-time, like email, comments in tickets, and even shared documents. Though some async modes of communication can become synchronous at times (I'm looking at your chat), the expectation is that you can take your time to reply to these communications.

### Use ☎️ **Synchronous** communications to get from:

#### Doing to Done Now ⚡
You need something completed (not just started) immediately. 
* Example: Call up everyone in the incident team to handle a security breach.

#### Uncertainty to Clarity 💡
You need people to understand an idea well, avoid miscommunications, and reduce back-and-forth
* Example: Set a team video call when doing retrospectives, where people can explain what went wrong, ask follow up questions and suggest permanent fixes to avoid future issues.

#### Arms-Length to Tight-Knit 👐
You want people to build rapport with each other. 
* Example: A new joiner should meet the team in-person or if that's not possible, through an on-cam video call.

### Use 📑 **Asynchronous** communications to get from:

#### Work to Deep Work 🔬
You want people to stay focused on their tasks.
* Example: Leave comments about coding style changes in the person's merge request, instead of chatting them about it.

#### Off-hand to Well-Thought Out 💭
You need people to respond to you thoughtfully.
* Example: Email your supervisor to get their feedback on your proposed change to task assignments.

#### No Knowledge to Understanding 👓
You're sharing a huge chunk of information that everyone needs to grasp well.
* Example: Create a shared document reporting how you plan to restructure the engineering team, including org charts, process diagrams and graphs.

#### Missing Out to Inclusion 🚸
You want everyone to participate and collaborate on something
* Example: Open a spreadsheet where people can add their ideas for new features, setting a future deadline when the sheet will be reviewed. This allows everyone from early birds to night owls, from local to foreign offices, to contribute their ideas at the time that's best for them.

### When Should I Use... ?

#### 📩 Email
1. For official communications like company-wide announcements, especially for large organizations.
2. For formal communications with outside entities, such as emailing contracts with suppliers.
3. Keep a permanent legal record of communications, like when initiating a performance improvement plan.

#### 📔 Shared Docs (Google Docs, Notion, Sharepoint, etc)
1. When the output is something that will be archived for long-term reference, like an inventory of servers or a contract.
2. When the output is meant to be shared with external entities or with the public, like an FAQ.
3. Keep track of changes for transparency and accountability.
4. Enable people to share complex ideas since documents allow you to attach images, graphs, tables and so on.

#### 🎟️ Commenting on Tickets and Discussion Boards
1. For topic-focused collaboration between teams in the org.
2. When you want to be able to reference the discussions in the future, since you can often link back to these discussions.
3. For messages that need responses within the day (like for tickets) or within a few days (like for discussion boards).

#### 💬 Chat
1. For casual and informal short messages, like asking for advice from a teammate or sharing memes.
2. Also for sending messages that you want to keep private or confidential.
3. For messages that need responses within the next couple of hours, max. Some messages, like for larger group chats, are answered within the day.

### ⌨️ Tips for Writing Professional Async Messages (chats, comments, and similar)

1. Keep it brief and to the point.
2. Check your grammar and spelling.
3. Use appropriate capitalization. All CAPS means shouting.
4. Use emojis, but not too much (and only the socially acceptable ones) 🆗
5. Add formatting for emphasis as needed, but also not too much.
6. Use the right tone. Good rule is to type as if you're speaking to them in person.

### 🗯️ Strategies for Managing Communication Overload 

1. Set boundaries. We're often expected to be available during core work hours but clearly communicate your availability during off hours as well, especially if that's expected of your role. One way is to respond to messages at appropriate times, to set expectations when you will likely respond in the future.
2. Use filters, mute channels, turn off notifications. 
* For high-volume chat channels, set those to mute and check as needed. 
* For email, add filters to archive persistent but unimportant messages. 
* Turn off notifications during work to avoid constantly checking your apps.
3. Go AFK once in a while to recharge. Taking a short walk throughout your shift is highly recommended.

### 🗒️ Note Taking
> Communicating with your future self is just as important, if not more important, as communicating with others

1. During synchronous communications (meetings, calls, etc), make sure to take notes in your favorite medium, whether that's writing in a notebook or typing on a note-taking app.
2. Write down only the most important ideas and don't be afraid to ask for clarifications during the meeting.
3. You can do the same for asynchronous communications, especially those that don't lend themselves well to a clear archiving format, like chats or comments. 
* Copy paste important data as needed for future personal (or shared) use. 
* Paraphrase ideas to ensure you understand them as you take note of them.
4. After your note-taking session, review your notes so you can digest the ideas and expound on them while the communications are still fresh in your mind.
5. Make sure to add easy-to-search terms in your notes for easy recall in the future.
